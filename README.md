# Introduction

*Knowin’ Notes* is an application that aids users in learning to sight read for piano. Users achieve their sight reading ambitions by correctly identifying musical notation (notes, chords, and arpeggiated patterns) with a MIDI keyboard or their device screen. As the user’s sight reading skills improve, they will be prompted with notation of increasing difficulty. Those who teach music, music students, and pianists that want to improve their sight reading abilities are demographics for which we expect Knowin’ Notes to have the greatest impact.
